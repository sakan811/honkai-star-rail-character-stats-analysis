## Overview

Eidolons and signature lightcone in Honkai: Star Rail can significantly boost a character's combat performance, but they require substantial investment in terms of Star Rail Special Passes or Jade. This tool helps quantify the value of each Eidolon level and signature lightcone by analyzing:

1. Raw damage increase per Eidolon and signature lightcone
2. Damage efficiency per pull
3. Marginal value of each Eidolon and signature lightcone upgrade

Data is based on:

## Generated Plots

This tool generates three different visualizations to help analyze Eidolon value:

1. **Average Damage by Eidolon**: Raw damage increase per Eidolon level
2. **Damage per Pull Efficiency**: Overall value proposition of pulls invested
3. **Marginal Value of Each Eidolon**: Return on investment for each Eidolon upgrade

For detailed explanations of each plot with examples, see [VISUALS.md](docs/VISUALS.md).
