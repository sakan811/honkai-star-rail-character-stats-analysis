## Interpreting the Results

When analyzing these plots together, consider:

1. **Budget constraints**: If you have limited pulls, focus on characters where the early Eidolons provide high marginal value
2. **Power spikes**: Some characters have significant power increases at specific Eidolons (often E1, E2, or E6)
3. **Diminishing returns**: If marginal value drops significantly after a certain Eidolon, it may not be worth pulling further

Remember that these analyses are based on damage modeling and your actual gameplay experience might vary depending on team composition, gear, and playstyle.
