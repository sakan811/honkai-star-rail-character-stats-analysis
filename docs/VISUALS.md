# Visualizations for Honkai: Star Rail Eidolon Value Analysis

This document provides detailed information about the visualizations generated by the HSR Eidolon Value Analysis tool.

## Generated Plots

### Characters

- [Castorice](./character_visuals/CASTORICE.md)
- [Ruan Mei](./character_visuals/RUAN_MEI.md)

## Plots Explaination

### 1. Average Damage by Eidolon

This chart shows the raw damage percentage for each Eidolon level, with E0 normalized to 100%. It helps visualize the total power increase from acquiring Eidolons.

**What this plot tells you:**

- The absolute damage increase from each Eidolon level
- The total power curve across all Eidolon levels
- Which Eidolons provide the largest raw damage increases

### 2. Damage per Pull Efficiency

This chart displays the damage percentage gained per pull invested at each Eidolon level. It represents the overall efficiency of resources spent to reach a specific Eidolon level.

**What this plot tells you:**

- How efficiently your pulls translate to damage at each Eidolon level
- Whether continuing to pull for higher Eidolons provides diminishing returns
- The overall value proposition of each Eidolon tier

This metric continuously decreases as you invest more pulls, with E0 being the most efficient since it's your first copy of the character.

### 3. Marginal Value of Each Eidolon

This chart shows the additional damage gained per additional pull required when upgrading from one Eidolon level to the next. It helps identify the "sweet spots" where additional pulls provide the best return on investment.

**What this plot tells you:**

- Which specific Eidolon upgrades provide the best value
- Where the diminishing returns or value spikes occur
- The most cost-effective stopping points for pulling

In many characters, certain Eidolons (like E1 or E2) might show significantly higher marginal value than others, suggesting these are good stopping points for free-to-play or low-spending players.

### 4. Light Cone (LC) Analysis

In addition to Eidolon levels, the analysis also includes the character's signature Light Cone (LC). Light Cones are weapons in Honkai: Star Rail that significantly boost a character's capabilities with tailored passive effects.

**What the LC data point tells you:**

- How the signature Light Cone compares to Eidolon investments in terms of damage increase
- Whether pulling for the Light Cone offers better value than certain Eidolon levels
- The damage increase from acquiring the Light Cone without additional Eidolons (E0 + LC)

The E0-LC transition in the Marginal Value chart specifically shows the value of pulling for a signature Light Cone compared to investing those same pulls into character Eidolons.

## Interpreting the Results

When analyzing these plots together, consider:

1. **Budget constraints**: If you have limited pulls, focus on characters where the early Eidolons provide high marginal value
2. **Power spikes**: Some characters have significant power increases at specific Eidolons (often E1, E2, or E6)
3. **Diminishing returns**: If marginal value drops significantly after a certain Eidolon, it may not be worth pulling further

Remember that these analyses are based on damage modeling and your actual gameplay experience might vary depending on team composition, gear, and playstyle.
