## Plots Explaination

### 1. Average Damage by Eidolon

This chart shows the raw damage percentage for each Eidolon level, with E0 normalized to 100%. It helps visualize the total power increase from acquiring Eidolons.

**What this plot tells you:**

- The absolute damage increase from each Eidolon level
- The total power curve across all Eidolon levels
- Which Eidolons provide the largest raw damage increases

### 2. Damage per Pull Efficiency

This chart displays the damage percentage gained per pull invested at each Eidolon level. It represents the overall efficiency of resources spent to reach a specific Eidolon level.

**What this plot tells you:**

- How efficiently your pulls translate to damage at each Eidolon level
- Whether continuing to pull for higher Eidolons provides diminishing returns
- The overall value proposition of each Eidolon tier

This metric continuously decreases as you invest more pulls, with E0 being the most efficient since it's your first copy of the character.

### 3. Marginal Value of Each Eidolon

This chart shows the additional damage gained per additional pull required when upgrading from one Eidolon level to the next. It helps identify the "sweet spots" where additional pulls provide the best return on investment.

**What this plot tells you:**

- Which specific Eidolon upgrades provide the best value
- Where the diminishing returns or value spikes occur
- The most cost-effective stopping points for pulling

In many characters, certain Eidolons (like E1 or E2) might show significantly higher marginal value than others, suggesting these are good stopping points for free-to-play or low-spending players.
